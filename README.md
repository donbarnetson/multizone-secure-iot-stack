# MultiZone Secure IoT Stack

The first Secure IoT Stack for RISC-V â€“ a secure implementation of freeRTOS with hardware enforced separation between the OS, TCP/IP stack and root of trust with TLS 1.3 / ECC for secure Internet of Things applications.

This reference implementation combines freeRTOS, picoTCP, wolfSSL and Root of Trust as physically isolated TEE zones
 - X300 Bitstream : Rocket core with Ethernet Peripheral for Xilinx A7-35T Arty Board
 - MultiZone Security Trusted Execution Environment configured for 4 Zones
 - Zone 1: FreeRTOS with 3 tasks (CLI, LED PWM, Robot)
 - Zone 2: PicoTCP + wolfSSL TLS 1.3 / ECC terminating Ethernet port
 - Zone 3: Root of Trust
 - Zone 4: USB UART Console

### Installation ###

The MultiZone Secure IoT Stack supports a multitude of hardware targets. For a complete evaluation of the framework it is reccomended to use the open source softcore X300 developed by Hex Five Security. It is an enhanced version of the E300 SoC (Rocket) maintained by SiFive - entirely free for commercial and non-commercial use. Like the E300, the X300 is designed to be programmed onto a Xilinx Artix-7 35T Arty FPGA.

Hardware prerequisites: Xilinx Artix-7 35T Arty, Xilinx Vivado, Olimex ARM-USB-TINY-H Debugger
 - Download the X300 bitstream .mcs file from https://github.com/hex-five/multizone-fpga/releases
 - Program the .mcs file to the Arty board using Vivado

Software requirements: Install the reference RISC-V toolchain for Linux - directions specific to a fresh Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, other Linux distros generally a subset. To connect via TLS you'll need a TLS 1.3 client. If you itend to use OpenSSL, make sure you have version 1.1.1a or greater. At the time of writing, OpenSSL included in Debian 9 (stretch) and Ubuntu 18.04.2 is version 1.1.0, which does not support TLS 1.3.   
 ```
 sudo apt update
 sudo apt upgrade -y
 sudo apt install git make default-jre libftdi1-dev
 sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libmpfr.so.6 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libmpfr.so.4
 wget https://github.com/hex-five/multizone-sdk/releases/download/v0.1.0/riscv-gnu-toolchain-20181226.tar.xz
 tar -xvf riscv-gnu-toolchain-20181226.tar.xz
 wget https://github.com/hex-five/multizone-sdk/releases/download/v0.1.0/riscv-openocd-20181226.tar.xz
 tar -xvf riscv-openocd-20181226.tar.xz
 git clone https://github.com/hex-five/multizone-secure-iot-stack
 sudo apt-get install libusb-0.1-4
 sudo apt-get install screen
```

If you have not already done so, you need to edit or create a file to place the USB devices until plugdev group so you can access them without root privileges:
```
sudo vi /etc/udev/rules.d/99-openocd.rules
```
Then place the following text in that file
```
# These are for the HiFive1 Board
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="0403",
ATTR{idProduct}=="6010", MODE="664", GROUP="plugdev"
SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0403",
ATTRS{idProduct}=="6010", MODE="664", GROUP="plugdev"
# These are for the Olimex Debugger for use with E310 Arty Dev Kit
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="15ba",
ATTR{idProduct}=="002a", MODE="664", GROUP="plugdev"
SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="15ba",
ATTRS{idProduct}=="002a", MODE="664", GROUP="plugdev"
```
Detach and re-attach the USB devices for these changes to take effect.

Add environment variables and a path to allow the Makefiles to find the toolchain

edit ~/.bashrc and ~/.profile and place the following text at the bottom of both files.
```
export RISCV=/home/<username>/riscv-gnu-toolchain-20181226
export OPENOCD=/home/<username>/riscv-openocd-20181226
export PATH="$PATH:/home/<username>/riscv-gnu-toolchain-20181226/bin"
```
Close and restart the terminal session for these changes to take effect.

### Compile and Upload the Project to the Arty Board ###

```
cd multizone-secure-iot-stack/
make clean
make
```

This will result in a HEX file that is now ready to upload to the Arty board. There is know issue with the first upload after board power-on: if it upload takes more than a few seconds you may want to kill the openocd/gdb process and repeat the make load. Otherwise the first load may take up to two minutes.
```
make load
```
### Add TLS 1.3 Support to Linux ###

As of Feb, 2019 - most versions of Linux do not have TLS v 1.3 support (which comes in OpenSSL v1.1.1) by default.  For Ubuntu 18.04 LTS the easiest way to add in this support is to download and compile OpenSSL 1.1.1 - it only takes a few minutes:

- Fetch the tarball: ```wget https://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-1.1.1a.tar.gz```
- Unpack tarball with ```tar -zxf openssl-1.1.1a.tar.gz && cd openssl-1.1.1a```
- Issue the command ```./config```
- Issue the command ```make``` (You may need to run ```sudo apt install make gcc``` before running this command successfully).
- Run ```make test``` to check for possible errors.
- Issue the command ```sudo make install```
- Backup current openssl binary: ```sudo mv /usr/bin/openssl ~/tmp```
- Create symbolic link from newly install binary to the default location: ```sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/openssl /usr/bin/openssl```
- Run command ```sudo ldconfig``` to update symlinks and rebuild library cache.

### Operate the Demo ###

The system contains four zones:
 - Zone 1: FreeRTOS with three tasks - CLI, LED PWM and Robot Control plus three interrupt handlers (BTN0-2) 
   - Press enter for a list of support commands
 - Zone 2: TCP/IP + TLS Stack (picoTCP + wolfSSL) - accessable via ethernet port
   - Ping to 192.168.0.2 (default address, set in Makefile)
   - Telnet to port 23
   - Connect via TLS: stty -icanon -echo && openssl s_client -tls1_3 -crlf -nocommands -connect 192.168.0.2:443
 - Zone 3: Root of Trust and Session Key Storage
 - Zone 4: MultiZone Console - access via USB UART at 115,200 buard 8N1
 
 Press enter for a list of supported commands
